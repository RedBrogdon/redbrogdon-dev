        This is the personal site of Andrew Brogdon. I'm a software engineer working
        at Google, where I lead the developer relations team for <a href="https://dart.dev">Dart</a>
        and <a href="https://flutter.dev">Flutter</a>, a motley assortment of engineers,
        tech writers, and program managers whom I'm lucky to work with.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you arrived here, you probably bumped into me at a conference or saw a video/blog/project
        that I worked on. Welcome!
      </p>
      <h4>A few, mostly random, things about me.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>At university I studied to be a poet, and you can still find one or two of my poems online.</li>
        <li>
          I once <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFWplUx3oZ0">co-hosted a tech
            livestream with Rivers Cuomo</a>, lead singer/songwriter for the band Weezer.
        </li>
        <li>My most prized possession is an original Bloom County comic strip.</li>
        <li>Work has taken me to 20 Google offices, 7 countries, and 4 continents.</li>
      </ul>

          I created this little guy using <a href="https://labs.google/fx/tools/image-fx">ImageFX</a>
          for a keynote on Flutter and Generative AI. Gemini named him "Saucy Sheldon." ðŸ˜€

      <h4>Working with Andrew.</h4>
      <p>
        I use LinkedIn and Bluesky (see links in the header) to connect with folks in the
        engineering community, particularly about Dart/Flutter and projects in the ecosystem.
        For whatever reason, giving out my email feels like telling someone my home address, so
        I tend to rely more on social media. Feel free to connect, though, especially if you want
        to share something you're proud of. I love raising awareness of other people's projects!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently based in Sunnyvale, California, but would love to move back to the
        jewel of the midwest, Columbus, Ohio. Flutter is global community, though, and I
        enjoy meeting folks from all over and trying their snacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        My way of learning a new language and/or UI framework is to code Reversi in it. Back
        in 2018 when I joined Flutter, I wrote this version (which is slightly janky due to
        the way isolates work on the web):
