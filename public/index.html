        This is the personal site for Andrew Brogdon. I'm a software engineer employed
        by Google, where I lead the developer relations team for <a href="https://dart.dev">Dart</a>
        and <a href="https://flutter.dev">Flutter</a>, a motley assortment of engineers,
        tech writers, and program managers that I'm lucky to work with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mostly this site is intended as a place to keep links to things I've worked on.

      <h2>I met Rivers Cuomo once.</h2>
      <p>
        Rivers Cuomo, the lead singer/songwriter for the band Weezer, is also a legit app developer.
        Seriously, check his <a href="https://github.com/riverscuomo">GitHub profile</a>.
        He agreed to be a part of our livestream at the end of 2024 and not only brought some
        really good questions but was exactly as nice in real life as you'd hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the shoot, a security guard who'd previously been working in the studio
        suddenly reappeared with a guitar case and an armful of LPs. He told Rivers that his son
        was the biggest Weezer fan in the world and asked if he'd sign something. Rivers took
        a good five minutes to autograph every record and drew a Weezer logo onto the guitar.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also did a great job trying to make the jokes I'd written for us land well, which is
        90% of what I look for in a co-presenter. ðŸ˜‚

      <h2>Reversi.</h2>
      <p>
        When I need to learn a new UI framework, I use it to write a Reversi game. Back in 2018
        I joined the Flutter team, and the first thing I did was write this version.
      </p>
      <p>
        (I then rewrote it, like, four times as I worked through being a newb and learned how
        streaming data, reactive UI, and a lot of other Flutter fundamentals work!)
